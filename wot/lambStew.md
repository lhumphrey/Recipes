# Lamb Stew

## Ingredients
- 3 lbs lamb shoulder or thick shoulder chops, cut in 2-inch chunks
- salt and pepper
- 3 tbsp flour
- 4 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 lbs onions, large diced
- 1 lbs carrots, cut in 3-inch lengths
- 3 cups chicken, beef, or vegetable broth
- 1 cup brown ale
- 1 large sprig thyme
- 3 lbs russet potatoes, peeled and cut in 2-inch chunks

## Instructions

Pat lamb dry, season well with salt and pepper, and toss with
flour. Put oil in stock pot over medium-high heat. Brown meat on all
sides, working in batches.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Set meat aside and add onions and carrots to pot. Season with salt and
pepper. Cook vegetables, stirring until lightly browned, about 5
minutes.

Return meat to pot, add broth, and bring to a simmer. Put in thyme
sprig and arrange potates on top. Season potatoes, cover pot, and
transfer to oven.

Bake for 1-2 hours, until lamb is tender.

## Notes

Instead of brown ale, you can use a smaller amount of red wine and
Worchestershire sauce.
