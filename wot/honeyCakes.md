# Honey Cakes

## Ingredients
- 1 1/4 c all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1 pinch salt
- 1/3 c unsalted butter, melted
- 1/3 c honey (plus extra for drizzling)
- 1/2 c sugar
- 3 tbsp light brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 c orange juice (or coffee or strong tea)
- 1/8 tsp ground cloves

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350. Grease 2 muffin tins (with 6 cups each) with
butter, oil, or non-stick cooking spray.

2. In a large mixing bowl combine flour, baking powder, baking soda
and salt.

3. Add melted butter, honey, sugar, brown sugar, egg, vanilla extract,
orange juice, and ground cloves. Combine just enough to incorporate
ingredients.

4. Pour mix into muffin tins. Tin cavities should be about half full.

5. Put in oven and bake for 15-18 minutes. Check doneness with a
toothpick.

6. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Use a butter knife to circle
around the edges of tin cavities and pop each honey cake out of the
pan.
