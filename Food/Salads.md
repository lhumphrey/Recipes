# Salads

## Asparagus Salad with Lemon Vin
Makes 2-3 servings

__Ingredients__

*For the dressing*
- 2 slices bacon
- 1 small shallot, sliced into thin rings and coarsely chopped
- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 0.5 Tbsp Spanish sherry vinegar (Vinagre de Jerez Reserva) or apple cider vinegar
- 0.75 Tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp sugar
- 0.5 Tbsp mayonnaise
- Salt and pepper to taste

*For the salad*
- â…” to 1 whole head of green leaf or butter lettuce
- 1/4 head radicchio, sliced into thin 1-3 inch strips
- Roughly 8 spears of asparagus, cut into 1-2 inch pieces
- Additional olive oil to cook the asparagus
- 1/3 to 1/2 cups grated or shredded Parmesan cheese
- 3 to 4 Tbsp pine nuts

__Instructions__

*For the dressing*

1. Cook bacon at medium to medium high heat in a skillet. After it
finishes cooking, save the grease but remove the bacon and set aside
on a paper towel-lined plate.
2. Take the skillet off the burner and immediately add the shallot.
Sautee the shallot until translucent but not brown, 1-2 minutes.
3. Transfer the grease and shallots to a large salad bowl. Mix with
olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice, sugar, mayonnaise, salt, and pepper
until combined.

*For the salad*

1. Add more olive oil to the skillet if necessary, then sautee the
asparagus in the skillet on medium to medium high until lightly
browned, 3-5 minutes.
2. While asparagus is cooking, tear lettuce into the bowl on top of
the salad dressing. Then add radicchio, Parmesan cheese, and pine
nuts.
3. Once cooked, add the asparagus.
4. Toss everything in the bowl until the dressing and other
ingredients are evenly distributed, then serve.
