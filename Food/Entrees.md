## Spicy Pork Tostadas (Tinga)

__Ingredients__

*For the tinga*

- 2 pounds boneless pork butt, trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 2 medium onions, 1 quartered and 1 chopped fine
- 5 medium garlic cloves, 3 peeled and smashed, 2 minced
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme
- Table salt
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 14.5 oz canned tomato sauce
- 1 tablespoon ground chipotle powder
- 2 bay leaves
- Red wine (optional, see notes)

*For the tostadas*

- 3/4 cup vegetable oil
- 12 (6-inch) corn tortillas
- Table salt

*For garnish*

- Queso fresco or feta cheese
- Fresh cilantro leaves
- Sour cream
- Diced avocado
- Lime wedges

__Instructions__

*For the tinga*

1. Bring pork, quartered onion, smashed garlic cloves, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt,
and 6 cups water to simmer in large saucepan over medium-high heat, skimming off
any foam that rises to surface. Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and
cook until pork is tender, 75 to 90 minutes. Drain pork, reserving 1 cup cooking
liquid. Discard onion, garlic, and thyme. Return pork to saucepan and, using
potato masher, mash until shredded into rough 1/2-inch pieces. Set aside.

2. Heat olive oil in a 12-in nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until
shimmering. Add shredded pork, chopped onion, and oregano; cook, stirring often,
until pork is well browned and crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Add minced garlic and
cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

3. Stir in tomato sauce, chipotle powder, reserved pork cooking liquid, and bay
leaves; simmer until almost all liquid has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove
and discard bay leaves and season with salt to taste.

*For the tostadas*

4. Heat vegetable oil in 8-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat to 350
degrees. Using a fork, poke the center of each tortilla 3 or 4 times (to prevent
puffing and allow for even cooking). Fry 1 at a time, holding a metal potato
masher in an upright position on top of each tortilla to keep it submerged,
until crisp and lightly browned, 45 to 60 seconds (no flipping is
necessary). Drain on paper towel-lined plate and season with salt to
taste. Repeat with remaining tortillas.

*To serve*

5. Spoon small amount of shredded pork onto the center of each tostada and serve, passing ganishes separately.

__Notes__

The trimmed pork butt should weigh about 1 1/2 pounds. If you don't have chipotle chili powder, you can use two minced canned chipotle chiles in its place. You can replace half or less of the reserved pork cooking liquid in step 3 with red wine if desired.
