# Weeknight Entrees

## Vegetarian Lasagna
Makes 4 servings

__Ingredients__

*For the vegetable portion of the filling*
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 large zucchini or 6 oz mushrooms, chopped
- 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
- 0.25 tsp salt
- 5 to 6 ounces baby spinach

*For the cheese portion of the filling*
- 2 cups (16 oz) low-fat cottage cheese
- 0.25 tsp salt
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 0.5 cups grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 tbsp dried parsley

*For the tomato sauce*
- 1 28 oz can diced tomatoes
- 0.25 cups chopped fresh basil
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
- 0.5 tsp salt

*Remaining ingredients*
- 9 no-boil lasagna noodles
- 12 oz (3 cups) low-moisture, part-skim mozzarella cheese
- Additional shredded Parmesan cheese (optional)

__Instructions__

1. Preheat oven to 450F.
2. For the vegetable portion of the filling, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in
a skillet, then sautee and salt the vegetables, adding each type at the
appropriate time so that they all finish cooking at the same time. Start
with the mushrooms if using, since they take the longest to cook. End
with the spinach since it takes very little time to cook.
3. While the vegetables are cooking, start making the tomato sauce by
heating 2 tbsp olive oil in a small sauce pan. Add the garlic and cook
until fragrant, about 1 minute. Then add the rest of the ingredients,
stir, and bring to a simmer.
4. While the vegetables and sauce are cooking, prepare the cheese
portion of the filling by mixing all ingredients in a moderately large
mixing bowl.
5. Once vegetables are done cooking, mix them into the cheese portion
of the filling.
6. Spread 0.5 cups of tomato sauce over the bottom of a 9"x13" baking
dish, then layer 3 lasagna noodles on top (there will be extra room in the
dish).
7. Spread half the filling over the noodles, top with 0.75 cups
tomato sauce, then sprinkle about 1.25 cups (about 40%) of the
shredded mozzerella on top of the sauce.
8. Top with 3 more noodles, followed by the rest of the filling, then
again sprking about 1.25 cups (about 40%) of the shredded mozzerella
on top of that.
9. Top with 3 more noodles, and spread 0.75 cups tomato sauce on top
of that (you may have extra left over). Sprinkle remaining shredded
mozzarella over the sauce, along with any additional shredded Parmesan
cheese.
10. Seal top with a sheet or two of aluminum foil. Bake, covered, for
18 minutes. Then remove the foil, rotate the pan, and continue cooking
for about 10 to 12 minutes more.
11. Remove from oven and cool for 15 to 20 minutes before slicing and
serving.

## Spicy Pork Tostadas (Tinga)

__Ingredients__

*For the tinga*

- 2 pounds boneless pork butt, trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 2 medium onions, 1 quartered and 1 chopped fine
- 5 medium garlic cloves, 3 peeled and smashed, 2 minced
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme
- Table salt
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 14.5 oz canned tomato sauce
- 1 tablespoon ground chipotle powder
- 2 bay leaves
- Red wine (optional, see notes)

*For the tostadas*

- 3/4 cup vegetable oil
- 12 (6-inch) corn tortillas
- Table salt

*For garnish*

- Queso fresco or feta cheese
- Fresh cilantro leaves
- Sour cream
- Diced avocado
- Lime wedges

__Instructions__

*For the tinga*

1. Bring pork, quartered onion, smashed garlic cloves, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt,
and 6 cups water to simmer in large saucepan over medium-high heat, skimming off
any foam that rises to surface. Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and
cook until pork is tender, 75 to 90 minutes. Drain pork, reserving 1 cup cooking
liquid. Discard onion, garlic, and thyme. Return pork to saucepan and, using
potato masher, mash until shredded into rough 1/2-inch pieces. Set aside.

2. Heat olive oil in a 12-in nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until
shimmering. Add shredded pork, chopped onion, and oregano; cook, stirring often,
until pork is well browned and crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Add minced garlic and
cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

3. Stir in tomato sauce, chipotle powder, reserved pork cooking liquid, and bay
leaves; simmer until almost all liquid has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove
and discard bay leaves and season with salt to taste.

*For the tostadas*

4. Heat vegetable oil in 8-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat to 350
degrees. Using a fork, poke the center of each tortilla 3 or 4 times (to prevent
puffing and allow for even cooking). Fry 1 at a time, holding a metal potato
masher in an upright position on top of each tortilla to keep it submerged,
until crisp and lightly browned, 45 to 60 seconds (no flipping is
necessary). Drain on paper towel-lined plate and season with salt to
taste. Repeat with remaining tortillas.

*To serve*

5. Spoon small amount of shredded pork onto the center of each tostada and serve, passing ganishes separately.

__Notes__

The trimmed pork butt should weigh about 1 1/2 pounds. If you don't have chipotle chili powder, you can use two minced canned chipotle chiles in its place. You can replace half or less of the reserved pork cooking liquid in step 3 with red wine if desired.
