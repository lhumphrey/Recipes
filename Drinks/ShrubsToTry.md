# Shrubs To Try

## Vanilla Cardamom Pear Shrub

__Ingredients__
- 5 ripe pears, diced large
- 1 vanilla bean, scrapings and pod
- 8 whole cardamom pods, lightly crushed and toasted
- 1.5 cups sugar
- 1.5 cups apple cider vinegar

__Instructions__

1. In a 2 quart jar, combine the pear, vanilla, cardamom pods, and
sugar. Seal the jar and rotate it several times to combine the
ingredients. Place on the counter for 48 hours, rotating the jar twice
daily to continue to mix the ingredients. The pears should release a
lot of liquid and the sugar should begin to dissolve.

2. After 48 hours, add the vinegar to the jar. Seal and rotate the jar
to combinen. Place on the counter for another 24 hours, turning
several times over the day to be sure that the vinegar dissolves all
of the sugar. Once the sugar has dissolved, strain the mixture through
a sieve over a large bowl, pressing down on the pears gently to
extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids. Transfer the
liquid into clean glass jars. The shrub can be stored in the
refrigerator for several months.
