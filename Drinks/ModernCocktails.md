## Dark 'n Stormy

__Ingredients__

- 0.5 oz lime juice
- Ginger beer, to top (about 5 oz)
- Lime wheel for garnish

__Instructions__
1. Add rum and lime juice to a tall glass filled with ice.
2. Top with the ginger beer.
3. Garnish with a lime wheel.

__Notes__
Gosling's Black Seal rum comes from Bermuda and has notes of caramel,
vanilla and spice. Technically, it's the only rum that can be used in
a Dark 'n Stormy, since the company that makes the rum has a
registered trademark. However, there are other rums with similar
flavors. Also, ginger beer rather than ginger ale is preferred for
this drink, but ginger ale produces a decent cocktail in this case.
