## Sugar Cookies

__Ingredients__
- 2 3/4 cups (358g) all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 cups unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1 cups + 2 tbsp (233g) granulated sugar
- 2 tbsp (28g) light brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 cups granulated sugar (additional for rolling)

__Instructions__

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or
silicone baking mats.
2. Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a medium sized bowl.
3. Cream the butter and sugars together in a large mixer bowl on medium speed
until light in color and fluffy (2-3 minutes). You'll know it's ready when you
see a color change.
4. Add the egg and mix until well-combined.
5. Add the vanilla extract and mix until well-combined.
6. Add the dry ingredients and mix until the dough is well-combined, but don't
overmix. The dough should be thick but not sticky. At the end, use a rubber
spatula to help the dough come together into a more cohesive ball.
7. Create 1 1/2 tbsp-sized balls of cookie dough. Roll each ball in additional
sugar to coat. Set the balls on the baking sheet.
8. Bake cookies for 7-8 minutes. They will spread and the centers will look soft
but done. Remove just before the edges begin to turn golden. They will be a bit
puffy at first but will flatten a little as they cool.
9. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on baking sheets for 4-5 minutes
before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
