## Chocolate Cake

__Ingredients__
- 2 cups (240 g) all-purpose flour
- 2 cups (396 g) sugar
- 0.75 cups (63 g) mix of regular and special dark cocoa powder
- 2 tsp (8 g) baking powder
- 1.5 tsp (9 g) baking soda
- 1 tsp (2.8 g) kosher salt
- 1.4 oz espresso 1 tsp (2.3 g) espresso powder 
- 1 cup (227 g) mix of milk and buttermilk
- 0.5 cup (99 g) vegetable oil or melted coconut oil
- 2 large (100 g) eggs
- 2 tsp (9.4 g) vanilla extract
- 6.6 oz (187 g) boiling water

__Instructions__

1. Prepare two 9-inch cake pans with baking spray or by buttering and
lightly flouring. Optionally use a cake sheet round with either
method.
2. Preheat oven to 350F.
3. Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt to
the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on the
lowest possible speed to combine.
4. Add milk, oil, eggs, and vanilla to the flour mixture and mix on
medium speed until well-combined. Reduce speed, add boiling water, and
continue to mix until well-combined.
5. Reduce mixer speed, add boiling water and espresso, and mix until
well-combined, but don't overmix.
6. Distribute cake batter evenly between the two prepared pans. Bake
for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick or knife inserted into the middle
comes out clean.
7. Remove from oven and cool to room temperature before frosting.


__Notes__
- You can use 1 tsp espresso powder instead of 1.4 oz of espresso, but
  the boiling water needs to be increased to 8 oz.
- For the cocoa powder, I generally use half unsweetened Hersey's
  cocoa powder and half unsweetened special dark Hersey's cocoa
  powder.
- For the mix, I generally use half whole milk and half buttermilk.
