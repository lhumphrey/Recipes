## Chocolate Swiss Meringue Buttercream

__Ingredients__
- 1.5 cups (300 g) granulated sugar
- 5 large egg whites (177 mL or 0.75 cups)
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 2 cups (453 g) unsalted butter, softened but not warm
- 12 oz (340 g) semi-sweet chocolate, as chips or chopped
- 1.5 tsp vanilla extract

__Instructions__

1. Warm up the bottom of a double boiler with simmering water.
2. In the top bowl of the double boiler, whisk together granulated
sugar, egg whites, and salt until well-combined.
3. Place the top bowl containing the egg-white mixture onto the bottom
bowl of double boiler, and whisk the contents until the sugar is
dissolved and/or the mixture reaches 160F (71C). When rubbed between
your fingers, the mixture should feel smooth and not gritty.
4. Transfer the egg-white mixture to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk
attachment, being careful not to drip any water that might be on the
bottom of the top bowl into the mixer. Beat the mixture on medium
speed to start, increasing speed to high and beating until the
resulting meringue is thick and glossy, significantly increased in
volume, and has stiff peaks (about 8 minutes).
5. Place chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 20-second
intervals, stirring after each one. Repeat until chocolate is just
barely melted. Set aside to cool to room temperature.
6. Remove the whisk attachment from the mixer and switch to a paddle
attachment. Wait until the meringue is roughly room-temperature before
proceeding to the next step.
7. Set mixer speed to medium and add butter, one tablespoon at a time,
waiting until each tablespoon is incorporated before adding the next.
8. Check that chocolate is still melted but not warm to the touch,
re-microwaving or cooling as necessary. Drizzle it into the
buttercream with the mixer on low-speed until incorporated.
9. Add vanilla extract to the mixer, scraping sides and bottom before
doing a final low-speed mix.

__Notes__
- Frosting may be kept at room temperature for up to 48 hours.
- Frosting can be refrigerated for several days in an airtight
  container with plastic wrap pressed right up against the surface of
  the frosting. It will need to be brought back to room temperature
  and re-whipped before using.
- Recipe yields approximately 6 cups of frosting, enough to frost
  about 24 cupcakes or generously frost an 8" or 9" 2-layer cake.
- This was just barely enough to frost a 4-layer 6-inch "fault line"
  cake.
- 1 cup contains 1057 calories.
  
## American Buttercream {#frostings-american-buttercream}

__Ingredients__
- 1 cup (230g) unsalted butter, room temperature
- 3 cups (360g) powdered sugar
- 2-3 tbsp (30 to 45 mL) heavy cream or heavy whipping cream
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- A tiny pinch of salt
- A tiny pinch of citric acid (optional)
  
__Instructions__

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large
mixing bowl using a handheld mixer, beat the butter until smooth.
2. Add the powdered sugar and mix on low speed at first, then increase to medium
speed and continue mixing for 1 to 2 minutes or until fully combined.
3. Add the heavy cream (start with 2 tablespoons and add a little more if
needed), vanilla extract, and salt and continue mixing on medium speed until
everything is well-combined, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as
needed.
4. Use the frosting to pipe onto cupcakes or frost a cake or cover tightly and
refrigerate until you are ready to use it.

__Notes__
- You can add extra vanilla (about 1 tsp) to amp up the vanilla flavor.
- You can sift in about 1/2 cup (40g) of unsweetened cocoa powder and mix it
  into the frosting base until well-combined. Add 1 to 2 extra tablespoons of
  heavy cream if needed for a smoother, creamier frosting. Add an additional 1/2
  cup to 1 cup (60g to 120g) of powdered sugar if you want to make it sweeter.
- You can mix in 1/3 to 1/2 cup caramel sauce. If using salted caramel, omit the
  salt in the original recipe.
- Add a 1-ounce bag of powdered freeze-dried strawberries and mix into the
  frosting base until well-combined.
