# Frostings

## American Buttercream

__Ingredients__
- 1 cup (230g) unsalted butter, room temperature
- 3 cups (360g) powdered sugar
- 2-3 tbsp (30 to 45 mL) heavy cream or heavy whipping cream
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- A tiny pinch of salt
  
__Instructions__

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large
mixing bowl using a handheld mixer, beat the butter until smooth.
2. Add the powdered sugar and mix on low speed at first, then increase to medium
speed and continue mixing for 1 to 2 minutes or until fully combined.
3. Add the heavy cream (start with 2 tablespoons and add a little more if
needed), vanilla extract, and salt and continue mixing on medium speed until
everything is well-combined, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as
needed.
4. Use the frosting to pipe onto cupcakes or frost a cake or cover tightly and
refrigerate until you are ready to use it.

__Notes__
- You can add extra vanilla (about 1 tsp) to amp up the vanilla flavor.
- You can sift in about 1/2 cup (40g) of unsweetened cocoa powder and mix it
  into the frosting base until well-combined. Add 1 to 2 extra tablespoons of
  heavy cream if needed for a smoother, creamier frosting. Add an additional 1/2
  cup to 1 cup (60g to 120g) of powdered sugar if you want to make it sweeter.
- You can mix in 1/3 to 1/2 cup caramel sauce. If using salted caramel, omit the
  salt in the original recipe.
- Add a 1-ounce bag of powdered freeze-dried strawberries and mix into the
  frosting base until well-combined.
